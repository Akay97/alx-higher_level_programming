# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures. The tasks cover fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming, including creating objects, understanding scopes, and working with closures.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple tasks, each addressing specific learning objectives. Each task is implemented in a separate JavaScript file and is accompanied by a main script for testing purposes.

### Task Descriptions
- **Task 0 to Task 6**: Implementing a class `Rectangle` with various functionalities such as defining a rectangle, printing rectangles, and manipulating rectangle properties.
- **Task 7 to Task 10**: Implementing functions to work with arrays and numbers, including counting occurrences, reversing arrays, and converting numbers between bases.
- **Task 11 and Task 12**: Working with arrays and dictionaries to compute new arrays and dictionaries based on given data.
- **Task 13**: Implementing a script to concatenate two files.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Code should follow the semistandard coding style with semicolons.
- The project structure should include a README.md file at the root of the folder.
- All files must be executable.
