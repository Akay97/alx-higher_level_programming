BaseGeometry Class README

This Python script defines a class named BaseGeometry, which serves as a base class for geometrical objects.

### Class Structure:

- **BaseGeometry:** A class representing the base geometry.

### Methods:

1. **area(self):**
    - Raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented".
    - Subclasses are expected to override this method.

2. **integer_validator(self, name, value):**
    - Validates the given value as a positive integer.
    - Parameters:
        - name: A string representing the name of the value.
        - value: The value to be validated.
    - Raises:
        - TypeError: If the value is not an integer.
        - ValueError: If the value is less than or equal to 0.

### Usage:

This class can be used as a base class for defining geometric objects. Subclasses can inherit from BaseGeometry and implement the area method according to their specific geometry.

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure to create an instance of a subclass to use the implemented functionality.
- This script does not include an example of how to use the class directly; it is intended to be inherited and extended by other classes.
